# prostojs/http

As an alternative for `express` and `fastify` this @prostojs/http brings the whole different approach for processing http requests.
It utilizes such a technique as you can see in React Hooks or Vue Composables. It has only a dependency on @prostojs/router (an alternative to `find-my-way` used by `fastify`) which is a very fast and robust URI router. It supports cookie parsing and serving files out of the box with no impact on performance.
